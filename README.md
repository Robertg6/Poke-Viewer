This repository contains a android app I have worked on using the pokeapi REST API, documentation avaliable here: "https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2"

The application pulls the information from the API using the Volley library and formats the data to allow for users to look at different pokemon and there accompanying
types a stats. Below are some screenshots of the application as it currently stands.

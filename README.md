This repository contains a android app I have worked on using the pokeapi REST API, documentation avaliable here: "https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2"

The application pulls the information from the API using the Volley library and formats the data to allow for users to look at different pokemon and there accompanying
types a stats. Below are some screenshots of the application as it currently stands.

This image shows the Recycle view that holds the images and names of the different pokemon, to view details of a specific pokemon a user only needs to select a specific entry in the list
